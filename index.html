<h2 class="text-danger">HISTROY OF BRIHADEESWARA TEMPLE....</h2>
<br>
<h5 class="text-info">The Chola kings’ achievements in architecture are perfectly exemplified in this temple. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Raja Raja Chola I’s display of might is a tribute. The Brihadeeswara Temple in India is one of the country’s greatest architectural wonders. It stands amid massive walls that date back to the 16th century, if not earlier.</h5>
<h5 class="text-warning"> The temple’s tower, known as Vimana to locals and visitors alike, is a popular pilgrimage destination. The height of this temple tower is 66 metres. The Vimana temple tower is one of the world’s tallest.</h5>
<h5 class="text-dark"> The Brihadeeswara Temple has a rounded apex construction that is thought to have been carved from a single stone.</h5>
<h5 class="text-danger">From the fifth through the ninth centuries, a spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to emerge under the control of the Chalukyas, as indicated by the temples at Aihole, Badami, and Pattadakal, and later under the rule of the Pallavas, as evidenced by the temples at Mamallapuram and other sites. Between 850 and 1280 CE, the Cholas rose to prominence as the ruling dynasty.</h5>
<h5 class="text-success"> Cholas placed a higher priority on maintaining their geopolitical borders during the early Chola period while placing less emphasis on building. In the tenth century, architectural characteristics such as multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals began to be developed within the Chola empire. The beginning of the new Chola style, according to George Michell, was signified by this event.</h5>
<h5 class="text-info"> The term “note” refers to the first letter of the word “note.” When it comes to grandeur and intricacy, the Brihadeeswara temple, erected between 1003 and 1010 by Chola monarch Rajaraja I, is the best example of this South Indian architecture.</h5>
<br>
<h2 class="text-danger">EXPLANATION (HISTORIC) OF THE BUILDING....</h2>

<h5>Thanjavur Periya Kovil is the most impressive of the Cholas’ creations, and it can be seen from almost anywhere in Thanjavur, making it perhaps the only temple in the world with this feature.</h5>

<h5>This temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site “Great Living Chola Temples,” dedicated to preserving ancient Chola culture. When the temple celebrated its 1000th anniversary in September 2010, it gained widespread attention around the country. The India Post issued a rupee postage stamp commemorating the occasion, which featured the 216-foot-tall Raja Gopuram (Vimana), which is the city’s most prominent landmark. The RBI has issued a five-rupee coin to commemorate the occasion.</h5>
<h5 class="text-muted"> It is planned to release a 1000 rupee commemorative coin with the same design as the 5 rupee coin of Thanjavur Periya Kovil in the near future. Even though it will be the first 1000 Rupee coins to be released in the Republic of India’s coinage, this denomination will not be available for circulation.</h5>
<h5 class="text-warning"> The bank issued a 1000 rupee currency note depicting a panoramic image of the temple in April 1954, commemorating the temple’s 50th anniversary. Later, during the government of Indira Gandhi, all 1000 rupee notes were demonetised to combat the circulation of black money.</h5>
